# Description

A fair warning the code in here is still under heavy development(bleeding edge).
So some of the docs may change at any time.

## TLDR

Basically it's a remake of the common function within the C language `printf`.
Right now we are not relying on any of the common C language functions like:
- `putchar`
- `puts`
- `vprintf`
or anything else that could make it easier.

The functions you will find in this project are mostly:
- `write`

That's pretty much it, with write you can use it just to print to the screen.
Other than that there's nothing much else besides that.

There's another document about [formats](./handling_formats.md) which you can read more about.
